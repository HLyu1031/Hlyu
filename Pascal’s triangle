Pascal’s triangle is a number triangle with numbers arranged in staggered rows. 
You can build Pascal’s triangle by adding the two numbers that are diagonally above a number in the triangle. 
An example of Pascal’s triangle is shown below:

        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1

Solution:


def combination(n, k):
	if k == 1 or k == n:
		return str(1)
	else:
		return str(int(combination(n - 1, k - 1)) + int(combination(n - 1, k)))

def pascals_triangle(rows):
	for row in range(1, rows+1):
		answer = ""
		for i in range((rows - row)*2):
			print(" ", end='')
		for column in range(1, row + 1):
			answer += combination(row, column) + "   "

		print(answer)
